# Music-Randomizer-PC
A mod for the OpenKH Mod Manager that randomizes the KH2 Music along with any other additions.

## How to use:
* Navigate to the extracted KH2PC folder
* Copy the bgm and vagstream folders
* Install the mod using OpenKH Mod Manager
* Navigate to the OpenKH `Mods` folder
* Paste the folders copied earlier
* Delete any files within that you don't want to randomize
* Make a new `bgmnew` folder
* Copy all the desired custom music into that folder
* Feel free to have subfolders within that folder or to rename the music files, but only the files that end in `.scd` will be considered
* Run `Randomize.exe`
* Follow the steps as if you just installed a zip seed to apply it to your PC
* Your music is now randomized!
