# Music-Randomizer-PC
A mod for the OpenKH Mod Manager that randomizes the KH2 Music along with any other additions.

## How to use:
1. Navigate to the extracted KH2PC folder
2. Copy the `bgm` and `vagstream` folders
3. Install the mod using OpenKH Mod Manager
4. Navigate to your OpenKH, folder, then go to `Mods/KH2FM-Mods-Num/Music-Rando-PC`
5. Paste the folders copied earlier
6. Delete any files within that you don't want to randomize
7. Make a new `bgmnew` folder
8. Copy all the desired custom music into that folder
9. Feel free to have subfolders within that folder or to rename the music files, but only the files that end in `.scd` will be considered
10. Run `Randomize.exe`
11. Follow the steps as if you just installed a zip seed to apply it to your PC
12. Your music is now randomized!
